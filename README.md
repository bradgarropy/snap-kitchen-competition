# 🏋🏼 Snap Kitchen Powerlifting Competition

*During an interview with [Snap Kitchen][1], I was asked to complete a coding question and actually run the solution using the editor of my choice. So I fired up [Visual Studio Code][2] and got to work. I really enjoyed this question because it revolved around my hobby of weightlifting.*

## ❓ Question

Write a program to simulate a powerlifting meet, where each lifter completes a squat, bench, and deadlift, and determine the winner(s).

Your program should:
* Generate a list of lifters.
* Randomize results for each lifter.

Bonus points if your program can:
* Accept the number of lifters as a CLI argument.
* Generate a random profile for each lifter.
    * Name
    * Photo
    * Gender
    * Weight
* Select winners based on different classes.
    * Individual Lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift)
    * Gender
    * Overall Total
    * Weight Class
